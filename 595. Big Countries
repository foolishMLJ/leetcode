Approach I: Using WHERE clause and OR [Accepted]

Intuition

Use WHERE clause in SQL to filter these records and get the target countries.

Algorithm

According to the definition, a big country meets at least one of the following two conditions: 1. It has an area of bigger than 3 million square km. 2. It has a population of more than 25 million.

So for the first condition, we can use the following code to get the big countries of this type.

SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE area > 3000000
In addition, we can use below code to get big countries of more than 25 million people.

SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE population > 25000000
As most people may already come into mind, we can use OR to combine these two solutions for the two sub-problems together.
写的时候要严格按照题目中的查找顺序和限制数字来
MySQL:
/***************************************************************************************************************************/
SELECT
    name, population, area
FROM
    world
WHERE
    area > 3000000 OR population > 25000000
;
/***************************************************************************************************************************/

Approach II: Using WHERE clause and UNION [Accepted]

Algorithm

The idea of this approach is the same as the first one. However, we use UNION instead of OR.

MySQL
/***************************************************************************************************************************/
SELECT
    name, population, area
FROM
    world
WHERE
    area > 3000000

UNION

SELECT
    name, population, area
FROM
    world
WHERE
    population > 25000000
;
/***************************************************************************************************************************/
